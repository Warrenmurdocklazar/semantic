#after running this code on, it picked up very strong similarites between both the complaint sentenaces and recipes sentences.
#However, when these sentences are compared together the similarity on average is still much higher than I would expect
#I assume this is because it's looking for comparable factors such as key words, length of sentenaces, amount of words rather than context of a sentence
